- `allow_remote_requests` (Boolean) Specifies whether to allow network requests.
- `cache_max_ttl` (String) Maximum time-to-live for cache records. In other words, cache records will expire unconditionally after cache-max-ttl time. Shorter TTL received from DNS servers are respected. *Default: 1w*

- `query_server_timeout` (String) Specifies how long to wait for query response from one server. Time can be specified in milliseconds. *Default: 2s*

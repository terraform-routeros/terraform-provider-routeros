## Schema

### Required

- `vlan_id` (Number) VLAN ID of the VLAN member entry.

### Optional

- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `flood` (Boolean) Enables or disables forced VLAN flooding per VLAN. If the feature is enabled, the result of the destination MAC lookup in the UFDB or MFDB is ignored,and the packet is forced to flood in the VLAN.
- `ingress_mirror` (Boolean) Enable the ingress mirror per VLAN to support the VLAN-based mirror function.
- `learn` (Boolean) Enables or disables source MAC learning for VLAN.
- `ports` (String) Member ports of the VLAN.
- `qos_group` (String) Defined QoS group from QoS group menu.
- `svl` (Boolean) FDB lookup mode for lookup in UFDB and MFDB.
    -  Shared VLAN Learning (svl) - learning/lookup is based on MAC addresses - not on VLAN IDs.
    -  Independent VLAN Learning (ivl) - learning/lookup is based on both MAC addresses and VLAN IDs.

### Read-Only

- `dynamic` (Boolean) Configuration item created by software, not by management interface. It is not exported, and cannot be directly modified.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
#The ID can be found via API or the terminal
#The command for the terminal is -> :put [/interface/ethernet/switch/vlan get [print show-ids]]
terraform import routeros_interface_ethernet_switch_crs_vlan.test *3
#Or you can import a resource using one of its attributes
terraform import routeros_interface_ethernet_switch_crs_vlan.test "comment=xxx"

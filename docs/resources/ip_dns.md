# routeros_ip_dns (Resource)
A MikroTik router with DNS feature enabled can be set as a DNS server for any DNS-compliant client.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "routeros_dns" "dns-server" {
  allow_remote_requests = true
  servers = [
    "2606:4700:4700::1111,1.1.1.1",
    "2606:4700:4700::1001,1.0.0.1",
  ]

## Schema

### Optional

- `address_list_extra_time` (String)
- `allow_remote_requests` (Boolean) Specifies whether to allow network requests.
- `cache_max_ttl` (String) Maximum time-to-live for cache records. In other words, cache records will expire unconditionally after cache-max-ttl time. Shorter TTL received from DNS servers are respected. *Default: 1w*
- `cache_size` (Number) Specifies the size of DNS cache in KiB (64..4294967295). *Default: 2048*
- `doh_max_concurrent_queries` (Number) Specifies how many DoH concurrent queries are allowed.
- `doh_max_server_connections` (Number) Specifies how many concurrent connections to the DoH server are allowed.
- `doh_timeout` (String) Specifies how long to wait for query response from the DoH server.
- `max_concurrent_queries` (Number) Specifies how much concurrent queries are allowed. *Default: 100*
- `max_concurrent_tcp_sessions` (Number) Specifies how much concurrent TCP sessions are allowed. *Default: 20*
- `max_udp_packet_size` (Number) Maximum size of allowed UDP packet. *Default: 4096*
- `query_server_timeout` (String) Specifies how long to wait for query response from one server. Time can be specified in milliseconds. *Default: 2s*
- `query_total_timeout` (String) Specifies how long to wait for query response in total. Note that this setting must be configured taking into account query_server_timeout and number of used DNS server. Time can be specified in milliseconds. *Default: 10s*
- `servers` (List of String) List of DNS server IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
- `use_doh_server` (String) DNS over HTTPS (DoH) server URL.
	> Mikrotik strongly suggest not use third-party download links for certificate fetching. 
	Use the Certificate Authority's own website.

	> RouterOS prioritize DoH over DNS server if both are configured on the device.
- `verify_doh_cert` (Boolean) DoH certificate verification. [See docs](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/DNS#DNS_over_HTTPS).
- `vrf` (String) The VRF table this resource operates on.

### Read-Only

- `cache_used` (Number) Shows the currently used cache size in KiB.
- `dynamic_servers` (String) List of dynamically added DNS server from different services, for example, DHCP.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
#The DNS Settings can not be imported. 
#Terraform will ignore the current settings and will overwrite the current settings with the settings defined in Terraform.
```

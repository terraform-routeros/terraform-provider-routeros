## Schema

### Optional

- `active_flow_timeout` (String) Maximum life-time of a flow.
- `cache_entries` (String) Number of flows which can be in router's memory simultaneously.
- `inactive_flow_timeout` (String) How long to keep the flow active, if it is idle. If a connection does not see any packet within this timeout, then traffic-flow will send a packet out as a new flow. If this timeout is too small it can create a significant amount of flows and overflow the buffer.
- `interfaces` (String) Names of those interfaces will be used to gather statistics for traffic-flow. To specify more than one interface, separate them with a comma.
- `packet_sampling` (Boolean) Enable or disable packet sampling feature.
- `sampling_interval` (Number) The number of packets that are consecutively sampled.
- `sampling_space` (Number) The number of packets that are consecutively omitted.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

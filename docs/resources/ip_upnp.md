## Schema

### Optional

- `allow_disable_external_interface` (Boolean) Whether or not should the users be allowed to disable the router's external interface. This functionality (for users to be able to turn the router's external interface off without any authentication procedure) is required by the standard, but as it is sometimes not expected or unwanted in UPnP deployments which the standard was not designed for (it was designed mostly for home users to establish their own local networks), you can disable this behavior
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable UPnP service.
- `show_dummy_rule` (Boolean) Enable a workaround for some broken implementations, which are handling the absence of UPnP rules incorrectly (for example, popping up error messages). This option will instruct the server to install a dummy (meaningless) UPnP rule that can be observed by the clients, which refuse to work correctly otherwise

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
terraform import routeros_ip_upnp.test .
```

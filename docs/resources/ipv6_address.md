- `eui_64` (Boolean) Whether to calculate EUI-64 address and use it as last 64 bits of the IPv6 address.

- `no_dad` (Boolean) If set indicates that address is anycast address and Duplicate Address Detection should not be performed.

### Read-Only

- `actual_interface` (String) Name of the actual interface the logical one is bound to.
- `deprecated` (Boolean) Whether address is deprecated

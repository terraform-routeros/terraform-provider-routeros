### Optional

- `___id___` (Number) <em>Resource ID type (.id / name). This is an internal service field, setting a value is not required.</em>
- `___path___` (String) <em>Resource path for CRUD operations. This is an internal service field, setting a value is not required.</em>
- `arp` (String) ARP resolution protocol mode.
- `arp_timeout` (String) ARP timeout is time how long ARP record is kept in ARP table after no packets are received from IP.

- `authentication` (String) Authentication method to use for VRRP advertisement packets.
- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `group_master` (String) Allows combining multiple VRRP interfaces to maintain the same VRRP status within the group.
- `interval` (String) VRRP update interval in seconds. Defines how often master sends advertisement packets.
- `mtu` (String) Layer3 Maximum transmission unit ('auto', 0 .. 65535)
- `on_backup` (String) Script to execute when the node is switched to the backup state.
- `on_fail` (String) Script to execute when the node fails.

This setting is ignored if the owner router becomes available
- `priority` (Number) Priority of VRRP node used in Master election algorithm. A higher number means higher priority. '255' is reserved for the router that owns VR IP and '0' is reserved for the Master router to indicate that it is releasing responsibility.
- `remote_address` (String) Specifies the remote address of the other VRRP router for syncing connection tracking. If not set, the system autodetects the remote address via VRRP. The remote address is used only if sync-connection-tracking=yes.Sync connection tracking uses UDP port 8275.
- `sync_connection_tracking` (Boolean) Synchronize connection tracking entries from Master to Backup device.
